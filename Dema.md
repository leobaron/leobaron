# What's Dema ?
## An introduction to the lore
### The world we live in
The story is set on the Continent of Trench, a wild green continent. We focus more on a few locations: 
- Dema, a circular cement city situated in the South of the continent
- Voldsoy, a wild part of the continent, inhabited by Neds
  ![this is a Ned, he's cute, basically a white furry creature with antlers, he's about 45cm tall](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/twenty-one-pilots/images/0/0b/Ned.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20200614014742)
- the Pladin strait, a body of water separating Dema from Voldsoy

### The storyline we follow
Throughout the different albums from the band, we follow the story of Clancy, an inhabitant of Dema who constantly tries to escape the city but gets consistently brought back by his bishop *Nico*

### How does Dema work
people in Dema are lead by bishops, 9 of them to be exact. Their names are __Andre, Lisden, Keons, Nico, Reisdro, Sacarver, Nills, Vetomo and Listo__.
Every inhabitant in Dema is assigned to a bishop who will watch their every move and make sure they follow the rules.
But what are the rules???
In Dema, everyone follows the same religion: vialism. Simply put, this religion teaches that suicide is the only way to paradise, self destruction is viewed as admirable within the walls of the city. 

# The link between the band and the lore: 
This story was created by Tyler Joseph, lead singer of the 2 piece band Twenty Ã˜ne Pilots. Throughout the 5 main album of the band, we have information about Clancy, Dema and Trench
# Vialism or weilism??
It has been recently confirmed (april 2024) that the idea of vialism has been highly inspired by Simone Weil and the idea of Weilism, in whch the idea of "overtaking your former self" is essential
