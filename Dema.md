## What's Dema?
people in Dema are lead by bishops, 9 of them to be exact. They're named after songs from the band, for example, the name SACARVER comes from the lyrics "She'S A CARVER" in the song _Tear In My Heart_.  

Every bishop represents an insecurity, depending on what your biggest insecurity is, you get assigned a bishop who will watch over you and make sure you follow the rules.   


Here's a table of the important information regarding the bishops

Keons      | choke on smoke (_Heavydirtysoul_) | Repetition

Listo   | a list of people (_Ride_) | Abandonment and overthinking
Lisden   | all I feel is deny (_Polarize_)| Not being enough
Reisdro   | temperature is dropping (_Doubt_) | Self-doubt
Vetomo  | will they be alive tommorow | Conformity
Andre   |and repeat yesterday's dance | Staying the same/ never changing

## What's vialism?
The only religion in Dema is Vialism. It is defined by Clancy as a "hijacked religion". It teaches that self destruction (i.e. suicide) is the only way to paradise. Dead people then become available "vessels", bodies to be possessed and used, for the bishops to use.

### Vialism or weilism??
It has been recently confirmed (april 2024) that the idea of vialism has been highly inspired by Simone Weil and the idea of Weilism, in whch the idea of "overtaking your former self" is essential

## The storyline we follow
Throughout the different albums from the band, we follow the story of Clancy, an inhabitant of Dema who constantly tries to escape the city but gets consistently brought back by his bishop *Nico*
Clancy has lived in Dema his whole life and at one point strated to realise that the bishiops weren't actually the good guys, they did their best to keep inhabitants numb and easy to control. Clancy tried to escape, each time getting further away from the city but he was always brought back by Nico or came back voluntarely because he didn't know how to live in the wilderness of Trench by himself. That is until he met the banditos, a group of people living outside of Dema who try to help people leave the city.
Clancy gained a reputation in Dema following his numerous escape attempts and  was at one point brought back by Nico and made to entertain the people. He appeared in a show called "Godd day Dema" in which he sang upbeat songs with hidden messages for the rebels.

## Additional information
Outside of the main story set in Dema, we have additional information about the area. The story is set on the Continent of Trench, a wild green continent. Throughout the albums, we focus more on a few locations: 
- Dema
- Voldsoy, an island East of Dema inhabited by Neds. Ned is the representation of Tyler's Creativity and his Hope. His antlers are the only thing that makes seizing possible.
- the Pladin strait, a body of water separating Dema from Voldsoy. As much as it provides protection for Clancy since the bishops do not cross the strait, it also separates him from the Banditos and makes it harder to fight Dema.
