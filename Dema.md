# The World We Live In ?
## An introduction to the lore

# How it started
the lore hunt started on the website, [DEMAORG](http://dmaorg.info/found/15398642_14/clancy.html) where Tyler updated letters written by a man named Clancy relating his life in Dema and his numerous escape attemps

### How does Dema work
people in Dema are lead by bishops, 9 of them to be exact. Their names are __Andre, Lisden, Keons, Nico, Reisdro, Sacarver, Nills, Vetomo and Listo__.
Every inhabitant in Dema is assigned to a bishop who will watch their every move and make sure they follow the rules.
But what are the rules???
In Dema, everyone follows the same religion: vialism. Simply put, this religion teaches that suicide is the only way to paradise, self destruction is viewed as admirable within the walls of the city. 

### The storyline we follow
Throughout the different albums from the band, we follow the story of Clancy, an inhabitant of Dema who constantly tries to escape the city but gets consistently brought back by his bishop *Nico*

### The world we live in

Outside of the main story set in Dema, we have additional information about the area. The story is set on the Continent of Trench, a wild green continent. We focus more on a few locations: 
- Dema
- Voldsoy, a wild part of the continent, inhabited by Neds

~~I am a citizen, I am an escapee, I am an exception to the rule, I am Clancy~~
