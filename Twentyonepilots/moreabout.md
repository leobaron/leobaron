The lore hunt started on the website [DEMAORG](http://dmaorg.info/found/15398642_14/clancy.html)

In June 2020, Tyler Jospeh started an ARG that had fans looking all around the internet in search of codes that would release clues about the "treasure" they were looking for. A code could be hidden anywhere (on a 2 year old tweet or as morse code in a picture from the merch store for example). Obviously Tyler hid 21 codes for us to find and once they were all put in a particular website, they unlocked a never ending youtube video of their song "Level of Concern" in which fans could appear by submitting any video they wanted to be played.
